# WEB SCRAPING CHALLENGE

For this project, I built a web application that scrapes various websites for data related to the Mission to Mars and displays the information in a single HTML page.

This web application will display followings

* Latest news from Nasa's web page for Mars 
* Latest featured image of Mars
* Mars facts
* Mars Hemispheres
